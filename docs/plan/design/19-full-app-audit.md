# Step 19 — Full-app audit

| | |
|---|---|
| **Status** | ⬜ Not started |
| **Priority** | — (gate before Figma conversion) |
| **Owns screens** | — |
| **Owns components** | — |
| **Reviews** | All 26 screens (S01–S26), all components, all tokens |
| **PRD refs** | [02 inventory + Figma doc spec](../../../prd/02-brand-design-system.md), [04 screen inventory](../../../prd/04-screens.md), [06 device matrix](../../../prd/06-responsive-layout.md), [08 B1–B5](../../../prd/08-deliverables-acceptance.md) |
| **Pen location** | Whole document; refresh `P0 Flow Board` |
| **Depends on** | Steps 01–18 |
| **Claude session** | `docs/claude-session/21-design-step19-full-app-audit.md` (written after approval) |

## Goal

Verify the finished Pencil design is **complete, consistent and convertible** before it is copied into Figma: every PRD screen/state/breakpoint exists, tokens are the only source of color/type/space, the component inventory matches the PRD (plus documented additions), and the PRD is updated to match design decisions made along the way.

## Inputs

- All steps' matrices and Session logs; the index's *Inventory additions* list.
- PRD 02 inventory (28) and PRD 04/06 screen and layout tables.

## Open questions (ask at kickoff)

1. Which PRD edits does the user want applied now (token divergences from step 02, `TsDialog`/`TsSnackbar` and other inventory additions, price set, and the Starter dark-mode workaround if step 01 chose two collections)? Approve the exact diff list before editing `prd/`. The window-class wording in `prd/06` was already fixed in step 01.
2. Any frames the user wants dropped or added before conversion (each removed frame saves Figma effort).

## Scope

### Audit tracks

| Track | Method | Pass criterion |
|---|---|---|
| Screen coverage | Script: expected frames (all matrices, PRD 04 states, PRD 06 rows) vs existing names | Zero missing; extras justified |
| Token integrity | Script over the whole document: fills/strokes/effects/gaps/paddings/radius/font size not bound to variables | Zero raw values (documented exceptions only, e.g. QR constants) |
| Component inventory | List reusable components vs PRD 02 (28) + additions; unused components; detached instances | Every PRD component present with listed variants; no unused; zero detached |
| Naming | Script: frame names match `S<id> <Name> / <State> / <Breakpoint>[ · Dark]`; every node named | Zero violations |
| Contrast | Script: resolved text/background pairs in light + dark | Text ≥ 4.5:1, UI ≥ 3:1, or documented decorative |
| Overflow | Clipping script over every root frame | Zero `problems` |
| Stress | Existence and cleanliness of 360×640 and ×1.3 frames for S05, S11, S16, S18 | Present + clean |
| Copy | Text-node scan: `Rp` format, dates, terminology, no lorem/placeholder | Zero violations |
| Continuity | Demo data (motors, plates, codes, totals) across S05/S10/S11/S16/S18/S20/S23 | Identical |
| Tablet | Every screen has PRD 06-conformant tablet frames | Per matrix |
| Dark | Every dark frame required by the rules exists and passes contrast | Per matrix |
| Figma compatibility | Check frames and components against the *Figma-plugin compatibility* rules in [`00-index.md`](00-index.md#figma-plugin-compatibility) (rules from the step 01 spike and the step 04 / step 12 test imports) | Zero violations |

### `/better-interface` runs (one per feature group — respects the skill's scope-narrowing rule)

| Run | Scope |
|---|---|
| A | Auth: S01–S04 |
| B | Shell + Home: S05, `AppShell`, `NavBar`/`NavRail` |
| C | Garage + Catalog: S07–S09, S12 |
| D | Booking core: S10, S11, S13–S18 (flow-level, complements step 12) |
| E | Tracking + Invoice + Review: S19–S24 |
| F | Notifications + Profile + Demo: S06, S25, S26 |

Each run: ≤ 15 findings, systemic root causes consolidated (token/component fixes outrank single-frame fixes); HIGH/MEDIUM fixed; LOW listed.

### Deliverables

- Audit report (tracks + `/better-interface` runs) in this file.
- PRD edit list applied after user approval (`prd/02` inventory + tokens + Figma dark-mode workaround, `prd/00` decision log; `prd/06` window classes already done in step 01).
- Refreshed `P0 Flow Board`; full-document PNG export set.
- Conversion manifest for step 20: component list with variants, style/variable list, screen list with node ids, plus the html2figma version and import options (Auto Layout on/off) that worked in the step 12 test import.

## Checklist

### Build
- [ ] Kickoff questions answered.
- [ ] All audit tracks run; failures fixed in the owning frames (logged against owning steps).
- [ ] Runs A–F done; consolidated findings recorded.
- [ ] PRD edits agreed and applied.
- [ ] Flow board refreshed from current frames.
- [ ] Conversion manifest written.

### Quality (automated, run in `execute`)
- [ ] Every script above re-run after fixes and reports zero violations.
- [ ] `placeholder` flags all cleared document-wide.

### /better-interface
- [ ] Runs A–F reports recorded below; all HIGH fixed; MEDIUM fixed; LOW listed; each verdict `Approve`.

### Review gate
- [ ] Status set to 🔵; user shown: audit summary table, PRD diff list, conversion manifest, flow board.
- [ ] Review rounds logged; user approval recorded (date + quote).

### Close (only after approval)
- [ ] Full PNG export set to `design/pencil/exports/final/`.
- [ ] Claude session file written.
- [ ] Tracker set to ✅; decision log updated.
